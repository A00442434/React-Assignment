                <p> Hi, I am Sivakarthikeyan and I am studying MSc in CDA in SMU, Halifax, Nova Scotia,Canada.
                    My student ID is A00442434. I had worked as a DB Admin in IAM,CyberSecurity which got my enthusiasm
                    towards databases and its structures. The courses which was taught to me in
                    first semester was so good in SMU and I am looking forward to upgrade my skill set
                    to stand out in the crowd.      </p>
